# Whatsapp-API2
## Project Admin Himanshu

### Description
> Proposed aim<br>

We aim to build a free Opensource API that will serve as an alternative to paid API's. Our API will help developers make efficient products that caters to needs of organisations that use WhatsApp as a mode of communication.

### Use case
Chintu was an organiser of an event and wanted to broadcast a message to the registered participants. But to broadcast the message , he had to select all the phone numbers and then broadcast the message. This is a time consuming and tiring job. There were other options of using API's ( which cost hell high!). Chintu felt need of a free API/ website that can help him out. He just simply send the message and all phone numbers ( in Comma separated format ) and rest job was done by the solution. 

### TO-DO's
- Go through the WhatsApp buisness API documentation.
- Building roadmap of entire project
- Brainstorming
